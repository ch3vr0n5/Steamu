# Steamu
This project is based on the idea and methodology of [EmuDeck](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck). It was originally a fork but being based on a different OS and different scripting language it has since be re-imported.

Steamu is a collection of scripts for Windows that automatically downloads, installs, and configures popular emulators for painless integration within the Steam library whether you use it exclusively on the desktop or prefer Big Picture Mode. It creates your roms directory structure and downloads all of the needed Emulators for you along with the recommended configurations for each of them. Steamu uses [Steam Rom Manager](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager) for this integration but is configured "out of the box" to work with [EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)](https://es-de.org/) as well.

There are two ways of using Steamu:

## Using Steam Rom Manager

This option gives you all your games presented with their box arts as if they were a regular Steam Game.
Steamu has preloaded configurations for Steam Rom Manager for the following systems:

## Using EmulationStation DE

<img src="https://es-de.org/____impro/1/onewebmedia/ES-DE_logo.png?etag=%226071-6041244a%22&sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&ignoreAspectRatio&resize=240%2B168">

Steamu configures EmulationStation DE to use the same rom folders that Steamu creates for you and it even downloads all the emulators and cores that EmulationStation DE needs. All configurations that Steamu installs are carried over when using EmulationStation DE. For a comprehensive list of all the systems that EmulationStation DE supports go to [EmulationStation DE](https://es-de.org/)

# Hotkeys

We try to use the same hotkeys for every emulator but some of them have their own that cannot be changed. Not all hotkeys are currently configured. This is being worked on.
